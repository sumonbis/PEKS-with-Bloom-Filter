# PEKS-with-Bloom-Filter
PEKS is one of the most used method to search keywords over encrypted data but can be susceptible to dictionary attack. In this project, I have implemented PEKS that originates from trapdoor permutations. Then I have used Bloom Filter to search keywords over the hashmap so that no dictionary attack can be made.
